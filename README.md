ðŸš—ðŸ”‹ Global Electric Vehicle Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

I recently created a Power BI dashboard to analyze the adoption of electric vehicles across the world.

 The dashboard includes:
 
 âœ… Global data on fully electric and hybrid vehicles
 âœ… Interactive filters for region, year, and vehicle type
 âœ… Custom DAX measures to calculate:
 - Total number of vehicles
 - Total fully electric vehicles
 - Total hybrid vehicles
 âœ… Dynamic visuals to explore EV adoption trends globally
This analysis can help identify EV growth patterns, highlight leading regions, and support data-driven policy & investment decisions in the EV sector.

ðŸ“Š Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization

 ðŸ’¡ Key Skills: Data modeling, measures, dashboard design, analytics storytelling
